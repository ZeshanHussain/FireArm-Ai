# FireArm Detection
This is not just a project; it’s the foundation of a startup I’m building to revolutionize security solutions. The goal is to create an advanced AI-powered surveillance system capable of identifying and responding to potential threats in real-time. Using the Darknet framework, I built and trained a specialized neural network designed to detect active shooter scenarios with exceptional precision. By leveraging a convolutional neural network (CNN), this project is designed to enhance safety and reliability in real-world security applications.

## Technologies Used

**YOLO/Darknet:** High-performance convolutional neural network framework.

**DarkMark:** Annotation and training tool for fine-tuning models.

**FlTM:** Used FLTM framework to write C++-based GUI I engineered for minimal memory consumption.

**C++:** Core programming language for the system’s backend.

 **HTML:** For explaining my goal for this startup/project.

**Twilio Voice API:** Facilitates instant voice alerts for critical situations.
