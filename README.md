# FireArm Detection
 When I Graduated from High School in May a week after the Uvalde shooting, I was in complete distress, all those kids had a future, a future full of energy that was taken away from them. I spent my entire summer trying to figure out ways and I found a way to help save lives. 
Im creating a camera that is using Open-CV that will be able to detect firearms.  If the camera detects a person with a gun it will trigger an alarm giving students more time for cover. I trained over 60 thousand images and created my own HAAR Cascade Image Classifier using a toy gun but in the future I will be using real Firearms for data and I need the community help with that part aswell.

Open-CV uses positive and negative images and you need a lot of them ...

Positive image is the object you want to detect !


While a Negative image is the surrounding area of the object. (Example: Trees, People , animals or etcc)
